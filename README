Hi Adam,

Stucture file defines the run class so have a look at the variables in that we can use for plotting
rates.py is the bit of code I made to determine the cooling rate.
Don't worry too much about this, all the rates themselves (and all data) is stored in processeddata.p

Plotting file is where the processed data is imported and some plots are made.
The 'investigation' and 'all data' objects are just lists of run objects.

Note for some of the variables stored in runs you need just the variable name e.g run.freezetemp
Some are accessed as methods e.g run.coolingrate()
Feel free to change the 'colour' method in Structure.py. At the moment its just blue for calibration,
red otherwise. Not sure if that is helpful for plot.ly but it can be used as an internal method for assigning plot styles
